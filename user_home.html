<h1>User Home</h1>
<p>A Simple Component
React components implement a render() method that takes input data and returns what to display. This example uses an XML-like syntax called JSX. Input data that is passed into the component can be accessed by render() via this.props.</p>

<p>
JSX is optional and not required to use React. Try clicking on "Compiled JS" to see the raw JavaScript code produced by the JSX compiler.</p>

<p>In addition to taking input data (accessed via this.props), a component can maintain internal state data (accessed via this.state). When a component's state data changes, the rendered markup will be updated by re-invoking render().</p>
